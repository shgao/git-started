		<p>Frodo is a mere hobbit from the Shire who takes it upon himself to destroy the One 
			Ring, which he acquires from his cousin, Bilbo, in the fires of Mount Doom.  He is 
			nothing without his 8 traveling companions: Gandalf, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, 
			Aragorn, Samewise, Peregrin, and Meriadoc.  During his journey, he experiences many 
			trials and tribulations, many of which are only overcome with the help of the heroic 
			Sam.  Ultimately, Frodo is successful in his quest and discovers the true thrill of 
			adventure and the meaning of friendship.  However, it is not a complete success as he 
			not only loses one of his fingers to the creature Gollum, but he also loses part of 
			himself forever.</p>

		<p>Frodo is from J.R.R. Tolkein's legendarium, primarily his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Lord of the Rings</a> trilogy.</p>
